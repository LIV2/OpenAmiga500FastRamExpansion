# OpenAmiga500FastRamExpansion
OpenAmiga500FastRamExpansion is an Open Hardware 4/8 MB Fast RAM Expansion for the Commodore Amiga 500 Computer.

### Summary
Most low-end Amiga models only came with *Chip RAM*. "Big Box" models allowed for a different type of memory to be installed, known as *Fast RAM*, where *fast* means that it's dedicated to the main processor, so that it doesn't have to compete with the other chips in order to gain access to it (as is the case with Chip RAM). While both Chip and Fast RAM are limited in size, you can have at least a few MB of the latter on all Amigas (usually up to 8), while the former can never exceed 2 MB.

OpenAmiga500FastRamExpansion will allow you to add 4 or 8 MB of Fast RAM to your Amiga 500. This way you will be able to run more applications at once and more quickly. If you combine it with [a chip RAM expansion](http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=85395), you will also be able to run almost all games supported by WHDLoad, pushing your Amiga to its limits. The Fast RAM will be mapped to `$200000-$9fffff` (`$200000-$5fffff` for the 4 MB version).

OpenAmiga500FastRamExpansion is basically a clone of [a RAM expansion produced by Kipper2K a few years ago](http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=64218), based on [an earlier design by lvd/NedoPC](http://lvd.nedopc.com/Projects/a600_8mb/index.html). He has since stopped producing and selling these cards and I thought it was a pity that he didn't open his designs and actually took all of them down, as this card is quite cheap to build and really useful. So I set about recreating it from scratch.

### Memory Compatibility
The required RAM Type is 16 Mbit (1MÃ—16) DRAM in the SOJ-42 package with up to 70-80 ns access time. It is 5v-only DRAM (not SD(!)RAM) often found in old 72-pin SIMMs, EDO chips might work or not. All chips having *8160* in their part number should be OK.

RAM chips can either be soldered directly to the board or installed in sockets. While soldering the chips might not be trivial for the unexperienced, sockets for the SOJ-42 package are hard to find and not really easier to solder either, so the choice is up to you.

### Assembly and Installation
Normally it is not necessary to mount all the decoupling capacitors. I usually skip C4, C5, C9, C12, C15 and C18. Maybe C1 can be left out as well if you have a good power supply, your choice. R4 must be chosen according to the particular led you will be using for LD1. Actually you are free to skip LD1 and R4 altogether, if you hate power LEDs.

After everything has been soldered, you will need to program the CPLD. Whenever you do so, **make sure to carefully remove the board from your Amiga, or you might risk damaging it**. You can find the firmware [here](https://github.com/SukkoPera/OpenAmiga500FastRamExpansion/tree/master/firmware), along with instructions on how to flash it. You can provide power through the pads of C1 if you need to do so.

Make sure to use the correct firmware version, according to how many chips you soldered on the board! For the 4 MB version, solder U7 and U8 only and use the dedicated firmware.

When assembly is complete, open your A500 and remove the top shield. Carefully remove the CPU (largest chip at bottom left of the board), using a chip extractor or a small flat screwdriver, taking care not to break/bend any pins. Plug it on the board, matching the orientation, and plug the whole board in the CPU socket.

Before reassembling your case, I recommend to run [SysTest/Amiga Test Kit](https://github.com/keirf/Amiga-Stuff). Use the Memory option (<kbd>F1</kbd>), it must show 4/8 MB of Fast RAM. Then start the Memory Test (<kbd>F1</kbd> again) and let it run for 50-100 rounds: if it doesn't find any errors, you are probably good to go. If you get any errors, check your solder joints, starting from actual the RAM chips, as the SOJ package is not very hand-soldering-friendly.

### Limitations
OpenAmiga500FastRamExpansion only has a partial implementation of the AutoConfig protocol. This has the following consequences:
- On the A500 it will only work if nothing is connected to the side expansion port (or if whatever is connected does NOT use AutoConfig).
- On the A2000 it will only work if nothing is installed in the first Zorro expansion slot (again: or if whatever you installed there does not use AutoConfig).
- On the CDTV it just won't work (since the DMAC uses AutoConfig and is built-in.)

The only way to get around these limitations is flashing an alternative firmware on the board which does not use AutoConfig, but then you will have to add the RAM manually in Workbench, using the `addmem` utility. More on this soon.

### Support the Project
Since the project is open you are free to get the PCBs made by your preferred manufacturer, however in case you want to support the development, you can order them from PCBWay through this link:

[![PCB from PCBWay](https://www.pcbway.com/project/img/images/frompcbway.png)](https://www.pcbway.com/project/shareproject/OpenAmiga500FastRamExpansion_V1.html)

You get my gratitude and cheap, professionally-made and good quality PCBs, I get some credit that will help with this and [other projects](https://www.pcbway.com/project/member/shareproject/?bmbid=41100). You won't even have to worry about the various PCB options, it's all pre-configured for you!

Also, if you still have to register to that site, [you can use this link](https://www.pcbway.com/setinvite.aspx?inviteid=41100) to get some bonus initial credit (and yield me some more).

Again, if you want to use another manufacturer, feel free to, don't feel obligated :). But then you can buy me a coffee if you want:
